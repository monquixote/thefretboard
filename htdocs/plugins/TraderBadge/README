This is an addon for Vanilla 2.x which will add role badges, similar to how
RoleTitle ( http://vanillaforums.org/addon/704/roletitle ) works, but
for CSS-able images.

Note: For 2.0.x "below" is the only setting that will work.
      For 2.1+ both settings should work.

To override the default images, simply create a CSS class in your theme CSS:
    span.RoleBadges dictates the default height and width
    span.<Role>Badge dictates the default role image, e.g. span.MemberBadge

TODO:
* Add option to show role badges on profile page
* Update to fully work in 2.0.x and 2.1
